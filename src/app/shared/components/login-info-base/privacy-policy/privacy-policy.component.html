    <h3>
      General Information on the Legal Basis of Data Processing on This Website
    </h3>
    <p>
      If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data
      based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of
      data under Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. If explicit consent has been
      given for data transfer to third countries, processing is also based on
      Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or
      access to information on your device (e.g., via device fingerprinting),
      data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TDDDG. Consent can be
      revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for contract fulfillment or
      pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
      If required to fulfill a legal obligation, processing is based on Art.
      6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest
      under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The specific legal bases in each case are
      detailed in this privacy policy.

      As part of our business activities, we work with various external parties.
      In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these external parties is
      required. We only transfer personal data to external parties if necessary
      for contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., data
      transmission to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest under
      Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in data transfer, or if another legal basis permits data
      sharing. When using data processors, we only transfer personal data based
      on a valid data processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a
      joint processing agreement is concluded.
    </p>

    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>
      Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit
      consent. You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time.
      The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation
      remains unaffected by the revocation.

      of your consent or in fulfillment 1 of a contract handed over to yourself
      or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. 2 If you request
      the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only take
      place if it is technically 3 feasible.
    </p>

    <h3>Information, rectification and deletion</h3>
    <p>
      Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the
      right to free information about your stored personal data, their origin

      You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your

        usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification,
        you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
        personal data.
      </li>
      <li>

        the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise,
        defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request the
        restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, a
        balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is
        not yet clear whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the
        restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data -
      apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for
      the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection
      of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an
      important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

      you send to us as the site operator.
    </p>

    <p>

      by us for the purpose of handling your request. We will not share this
      data without your consent.
    </p>
    <p>

      provided your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is
      necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other
      cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective
      processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on
      your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; the
      consent is revocable at any time.

      processed). Mandatory legal provisions &ndash; in particular legal
      retention periods &ndash; remain unaffected.
